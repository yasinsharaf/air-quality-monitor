# Real-Time Environmental and Tourism Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Description

The Real-Time Environmental and Tourism Monitoring Dashboard is designed to provide tourists with up-to-date insights into environmental conditions and tourism activities. By offering real-time information, this project aims to enhance travel safety and experience by helping tourists avoid areas with poor air quality, contaminated water sources, and overcrowded attractions. The dashboard integrates data from various sources, processes it in real-time, and presents it through comprehensive visualizations, enabling informed travel decisions.

## Architecture

This project leverages the Kappa architecture to handle both real-time and batch data processing seamlessly. The Kappa architecture is applied as follows:

- **Data Sources:** Real-time environmental sensors (air quality, water quality) and batch data from tourism feeds and user interaction logs.
- **Ingestion Layer:** Azure Functions for real-time data and Azure Data Factory (ADF) for batch data ingestion.
- **Processing Layer:** Azure Databricks with Spark Structured Streaming to process and transform both real-time and batch data.
- **Storage Layer:** Data is stored hierarchically in Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Bronze, Silver, Gold tiers).
- **Serving Layer:** Processed and curated data is loaded into Snowflake for querying and reporting.
- **Visualization:** Power BI is used to create dashboards that display real-time and batch data metrics.
- **Security:** Azure Key Vault is employed for managing secrets and securing access to resources.
- **Testing and Validation:** dbt is used for building, testing, and documenting data transformations, while Great Expectations provides continuous data profiling and validation.
